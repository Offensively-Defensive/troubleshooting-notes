## 🧰 Device Audit and Database Integration

### 📝 Overview
While reviewing stored student tablets, I discovered several devices that weren’t fully integrated into the district’s management systems. These untracked units couldn’t be issued to students, leaving them effectively unusable within inventory. I took initiative to document and organize their status for correction.

### ⚙️ Actions Taken
-  Tested functionality of eight student tablets (power, OS, Wi-Fi, touchscreen).  
-  Verified asset tags, serial numbers, and device types.  
-  Checked MDM enrollment and cross-referenced with district asset databases.  
-  Created a spreadsheet logging each device’s condition, database status, and required actions.  
-  Forwarded findings and documentation to district IT administration.

### ✅ Outcome
-  Identified devices missing from official databases.  
-  Improved accuracy of asset records and readiness for distribution.  
-  Provided a structured dataset for IT staff to complete integration.

### 💡 Lessons Learned
-  Asset visibility is crucial for large-scale device deployments.  
-  Routine audits prevent workflow delays and lost inventory.  
-  Even during low-activity periods, proactive documentation adds measurable value.

# Dell Latitude 5440 – Audio Device (Code 10) Resolution  
**Device:** Dell Latitude 5440  
**OS:** Windows 11  
**Issue:** Audio and microphone not detected; Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) driver showing Code 10 error  

---

## Symptoms  
- System reported **no speakers or microphone detected**.  
- **Intel Smart Sound Technology (Intel SST)** device in Device Manager showed **Code 10 – device cannot start**.  
- Attempting to update drivers or use Windows Update did not restore functionality.  
- Uninstalling and reinstalling Intel Smart Sound repeatedly failed.  

---

## Initial Troubleshooting  
1. Verified physical output and system volume controls.  
2. Confirmed **Windows Audio** service was running.  
3. Attempted standard driver update through Device Manager → *Update driver*.  
4. Removed the Intel SST driver showing error → issue persisted (no audio output).  

---

## Corrective Actions  
1. **Uninstalled all audio-related devices** in Device Manager:  
   - Under *Sound, video and game controllers* and *System devices*, removed every entry labeled **Intel Smart Sound**, **Intel DSP**, or **High Definition Audio Device**.  
   - Selected “**Delete the driver software for this device**” for each.  
2. **Restarted system** (Windows auto-detected generic audio hardware).  
3. **Sound and mic returned to normal operation automatically** upon reboot using the generic **High Definition Audio** driver.  

---

## Outcome  
- Audio playback and recording fully restored.  
- No further error codes in Device Manager.  
- System functioning normally without Intel Smart Sound driver reinstallation.  

---

## Notes  
- Windows may successfully initialize the **generic HD Audio driver** once conflicting Intel SST components are removed.  
- Manufacturer-supplied SST drivers can reintroduce the issue if reinstalled unnecessarily.  
- Recommended action if problem recurs:  
  - Remove SST entries again, reinstall latest **Chipset** and **Realtek Audio** drivers from Dell support in that order.  

**Result:** Device audio restored after complete driver removal and reboot.

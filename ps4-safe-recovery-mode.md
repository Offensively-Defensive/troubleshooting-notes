## üß† Reflection  

This troubleshooting scenario reflects basic incident response logic:
- **Safe Mode** = diagnostic boot environment  
- **Manual Update** = patch validation step  
- **Rebuild Database** = repair corrupted index structure  
- **Final Update Success** = confirms root issue was a corrupted file structure, not the update package itself

Though not enterprise-level, this fix mirrors endpoint remediation flow: boot diagnostics ‚Üí layered recovery attempts ‚Üí root-cause resolution.
